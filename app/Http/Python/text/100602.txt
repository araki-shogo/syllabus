概要

到達目標

This course will help students build confidence in speaking English. Now is the time to skill up an
d communicate with your friends and people around the world. We will study real English for real 
situations (e.g. restaurants, shops, travel, parties, etc.). We can develop our ideas and build rela
tionships by increasing opportunities to use new phrases and vocabulary.�

Speaking will be the key to this course but you will also be able to read a variety of texts and try
discussing them. At the end of the course you should be able to read a text without too much tr
anslating and speak about the things you have read.�

実践的スキル

 

This course should help to build on the phrases and speech patterns you know. Pronunciation p
ractice and grammatical improvements will help your confidence. We will try to set up some sc
enarios in which you might find yourself speaking English. For example, in the work place, chatt
ing with foreigners, talking with officials, dealing with problems abroad. Also you should be rea
dy to help your classmates to improve. If you think you can help them, please try to motivate 
each other. Also your ideas on what you want to study will be listened to, I promise! We will foll
ow a course book, but you will need something to keep all extra handouts materials. (Go to a 1
00yen shop and buy a folder). Also, bring a dictionary.�
