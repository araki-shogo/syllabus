概要

In this Extensive Reading class students will read many books from the Extensive Reading 
Section in our university library, and take quizzes on their reading.�

The goal of this class is to help students improve their reading ability by reading extensively at a
level determined by their TOEIC Score. By reading at the appropriate level, students should 
be able to improve their reading speed, increase their general knowledge of grammar, 
increase the speed at which they can process a new text, and even learn new vocabulary 
indirectly through repeated exposure rather than through use of a dictionary. Most of all, they 
should come to enjoy reading in English.�
