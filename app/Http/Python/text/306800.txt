概要

到達目標

In this class we will continue to study about the development of English as a global language
with emphasis on modern historical events that facilitated its development. Finally, we will 
take a look at the role of English in some some countries where English is used as a second
or foreign language.�

The students will gain a good general understanding of how English became a world language
and how the spread of English has changed the world. In addition, students will gain more
understanding of the role of English in this country now and in the future.�
