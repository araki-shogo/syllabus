概要

到達目標

In this seminar, we will continue to investigate the language and culture found in children's pictur
e 
books. The class will take a creative writing-discovery approach. �

Students will gain an insight into their own culture as well as the English speaking culture as
expressed through children's picture books. Finally, they will get an opportunity to take an 
active role in conveying some of that culture through their own original creations.�

In the first semester, the students will create as many original stories as time allows. The 
students will translate these stories into English and during class, we will discuss and
